# Splendor

An online clone of my favorite board game. I'm building it to exercise my full-stack skills.

## Rules

A game may be played by two, three, or four players.

The goal of the game is to earn the most points.

When you buy a card, you gain any points on it.

You buy cards by paying for their cost in gems.

You gain gems by taking tokens and buying cards.

To buy a card, for each gem count required, first count the number of gems you have on cards. Pay the remainder (if any) in tokens.

You may not buy a card that you cannot pay for.
